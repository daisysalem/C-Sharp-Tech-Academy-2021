Here are some small projects made using C#, .NET Framework, and MVC.

Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website.  It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on a business logic.  There is also an Admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

This is a console application to provide a shipping quote for a user.  It takes user's input to determine if a package is qualified to ship and, if so, at what cost to user.
